## Covariance estimation

* rCholCov() 
  * positive semi-definite covariance estimation using the CholCov algorithm. Details on page 70-72 of the R Documentation.
* rCov()
  * returns the Realized Covariation
  * Let $r_{t,i}$ be an intraday $N X M$ return vector and $i = 1,...,M$ the number of intraday returns. Then $rCov_t = \sum_{i=1}^{M}r_{t,i}r'_{t,i}$
* ReMeDI()
  * estimates the auto-covariance of market-microstructure noise. Details on page 74-75 of the R Documentation.
  * ReMeDIAsymptoticVariance(): estimates the asymptotic variance of the ReMeDI estimator.
* rHYCov()
  * calculates the Hayashi-Yoshia covariance estimator. Details on Hayashi, T. and Yoshida, N. (2005). On covariance estimation of non-synchronously observed diffusion processes. Bernoulli, 11, 359-379.
* rKernelCov()
  * realized covariance calculation using a kernel estimator. Available kernels: rectangular, bartlett, second-order, epanechnikov, cubiic, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, parzen, tukeyhanning, modifiedtukeyhanning. Details on page 80 of the R Documentation.
* rMPV()
  * calculates the realized multipower variation, as defined in Andersen, T. G., Dobrev, D., and Schaumburg, E. (2012). Jump-robust volatility estimation using nearest neighbor truncation. Journal of Econometrics, 169, 75-93. Details on page 90 of the R Documentation.
* rMRC()
  * modulated realized covariance. Calculates the univariate or multivariate pre-averaged estimator. Details on page 91 of the R Documentation.
* rOWCov()
  * calculates the realized outlyingness weighted covariance, defined in Boudt, K., Croux, C., and Laurent, S. (2008). Outlyingness weighted covariation. Journal of Financial Econometrics, 9, 657â€“684. Details on page 95.
* rQPVar()
  * realized quad-power variation of intraday returns. Details on page 97.
* rRTSCov()
  * calculates the robust two time scale covariance matrix. Details on page 99-101.
* rSemiCov()
  * calculates the realized semicovariances. Details on page 102.
* rSV()
  * calculates the realized semivariances of highfrequency return series with two outcomes: downside realized semivariance and upside realized semivariance. Details on page 105.
* rThresholdCov()
  * calculates the threshold covariance matrix. Details on page 106.
* rTSCov()
  * calculates the two time scale covariance matrix. By the use of two time scales, this covariance estimate is robust to microstructure noise and non-synchronic trading.
* RV()
  * an estimator of realized variance.

## Other

* refreshTime()
  * implements the refresh time synchronization scheme proposed in: Harris, F., T. McInish, Shoesmith, G., and Wood, R. (1995). Cointegration, error correction, and price discovery on informationally linked security markets. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 30, 563-581. It picks the so-called refresh times at which all assets have traded at least once since the last refresh time point. For example, the first refresh time corresponds to the first time at which all stocks have traded. The subsequent refresh time is defined as the first time when all stocks have traded again. This process is repeated until the end of one time series is reached.

## Other Estimations

* rMedRQ()
  * an estimator of integrated quarticity from applying the median operator on blocks of three returns. Defined in Andersen, T. G., Dobrev, D., and Schaumburg, E. (2012). Jump-robust volatility estimation using nearest neighbor truncation. Journal of Econometrics, 169, 75-93. Details on page 82 of the R Documentation.
